### Hello, I'm Ibrahim

I am an experienced **Software Solution Architect** with a passion for using technology to solve the practical, day-to-day problems we face. 

This site serves as my **Digital Garden**—a living collection of notes, architectural patterns, and experiments that evolve over time. While these pages document my own learning journey, my hope is that they also help you solve similar challenges in your own projects.

### What I Explore
My interests are broad and often overlap. You’ll find me writing about:

* **Software Architecture & Programming:** Building scalable, clean, and efficient systems.
* **The Home Lab:** Self-hosting, Proxmox/Docker, and infrastructure-as-code.
* **Home Automation:** Making technology invisible and helpful within the home.
* **AI/ML:** Implementing machine learning to solve niche problems.
* **Audiophile Topics:** The intersection of high-fidelity sound and engineering.

### Philosophy & Open Knowledge
